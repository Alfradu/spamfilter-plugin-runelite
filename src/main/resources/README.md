These files contain anonymous and unedited excerpts from the public game chat.
They have been categorised into "spam" and "not spam" (under the names "good_corpus" and "bad_corpus") based on whether or not I subjectively thought they were spam.

"Not spam" is not an endorsement of the message; as you may expect, there exist "legitimate" messages with unpleasant content.
